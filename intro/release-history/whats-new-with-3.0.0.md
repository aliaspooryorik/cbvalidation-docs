# What's New With 3.0.0

This is a major release as we have updated the internal cbi18n library from v1.x to v2.x and bringing compatibility issues on how you declare your localization settings in ColdBox.  Please see the compatibility guide here on how to update your localization settings. \([https://coldbox-i18n.ortusbooks.com/intro/release-history/whats-new-with-2.0.0\#compatibility-updates](https://coldbox-i18n.ortusbooks.com/intro/release-history/whats-new-with-2.0.0#compatibility-updates)\)
